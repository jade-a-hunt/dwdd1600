        <p>Hey all, I just wanted to share why I think cozy gaming is the <strong>best</strong> and hear some of your
            thoughts and opinions on the topic. For me, cozy gaming gives me a sense of accomplishment while allowing me
            to disconnect from the world around me. I can forget the stresses of the day and just relax. It also helps
            to curb my anxiety levels and improves my mental health. There are some pretty serious topics in some cozy
            games, which have helped me work through my issues and trauma. What a <em>nice little bonus</em>, haha. I've
            also found that cozy gaming has helped stimulate my creativity. These games give me the freedom to craft,
            decorate, and design the world around me with little to no limitations. What do you think about cozy gaming?
            I'd love to hear your ideas.</p>

        <h2>What is the Best Console for Cozy Gaming?</h2>

        <p>I've seen much debate about the best console for cozy gaming. While I enjoy playing games on an Xbox,
            PlayStation, and PC, I believe the true OP console for cozy gaming in the <strong>Nintendo Switch</strong>.
            Don't get me wrong, the other consoles I mentioned are amazing, but I feel that the switch is unmatched.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>I can take the switch with me anywhere I'd like to go.</li>
            <li>I can play games while cuddling up in bed and dock the switch to cast it to the TV.</li>
            <li>It has first-party games like Yoshi's Crafted World and Captain Toad Treasure Tracker, which are only
                available on the Nintendo Switch consoles.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>What about you? What is your favorite console?</p>
