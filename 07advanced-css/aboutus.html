        <h2>Our Mission Statement</h2>
        <p>We are a community-driven website dedicated to cozy gaming. Our mission is to provide helpful tips, tricks,
            and insights on games, consoles, and more-guiding you through a relaxing and enjoyable gaming experience.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Hygge Pixels was born from a simple yet heartfelt realization-gaming should be a place of comfort,
            connection, and joy. For founder Jade, gaming had always been a casual pastime, but she often felt out of
            place in the mainstream gaming communities. Competitive shooters and massive online battles weren't her
            style, and for a while, she wondered if there was a space for players like her. That changed when she
            discovered the cozy gaming community-a world where games could be slow-paced, immersive, and
            heartwarming.<br>
            Inspired by this new sense of belonging, Jade wanted to create a space where others could experience the
            same warmth and connection. In the spring of 2025, she launched Hygge Pixels-a website dedicated to
            celebrating cozy gaming, sharing helpful tips, and bringing all like-minded gamers together. <br>
            Today, Hygge Pixels is more than just a resource; it's a welcoming community built on the belief that gaming
            can be a source of relaxation, creativity, and friendship. When she's not curating content for the site,
            Jade enjoys spending time with loved ones, and, of course, unwinding with her pets and a good cozy game.
            <br>
            Welcome to Hygge Pixels-where gaming feels like home.
